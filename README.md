# Bookmark-Auto-Organizer
Literally the name explains all

This is a Chrome extension that aims to organize a user's bookmark bar by automatically moving bookmarks the user has visited most recently to the top of your bookmark bar. This makes the bookmark bar similar to a browsing history, but it is less cluttered than a browser history because it includes only pages that the user has previously marked.
